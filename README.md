# Cube Inspector v0.1.0

Simple GUI program for inspecting and analyzing hyperspectral image 
cubes that have been saved in ENVI format.

The UI elements do have tooltips, so it should be fairly easy to decipher 
what you can do with it.

Cube Inspector tries to save your current state (image cubes and used RGB bands) 
upon closing.

Note that this is veeeeery early version of the software, so be prepared for 
crashes and weird behavior. There is an embedded console window to help you. 
No logs though at the moment.
